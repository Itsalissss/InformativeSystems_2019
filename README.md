# InformativeSystems_2019

Project developed for the course in "Informative Systems" (2019). Students were free to choose both the topic and which query to implement, as long as the project would constitute an interesting relational database.

The scope was to implement a relational database to support the chosen topic, fill it with fictional data and query that database.
