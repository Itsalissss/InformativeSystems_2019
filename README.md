# InformativeSystems_2019

Project developed for the course in "Informative Systems" (2019). Students were free to choose both the topic and which queries to implement, as long as the project would constitute an interesting relational database.

The scope was to implement a relational database to support the chosen topic, fill it with fictional data and query that database.

The specifics of the chosen topic, the architecture of the database and the queries can be found in file "Progetto.pdf".
